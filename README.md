### Test

Jest is used for testing. To test, run:

```bash

```

### Design

Inspired by [Apollo App](https://apolloapp.io), I tried to design hackd around an iOS centric theme.

The comments design in hackd is based off a stripped down version of Apollo's comments.

Hackd also supports font scaling for readers who want smaller or larger text.

I've tried to add and support as many native API's as possible such as haptic feedback and 3D touch. Although many new API's aren't available in the React Native environment yet.

<sup id="1">1</sup> 3D touch is only available on supported devices. Currently only Wix's [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) supports it, although there is a [relatively major bug](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/issues/2445) that hasn't been fixed yet. This bug is present in Hackd.
